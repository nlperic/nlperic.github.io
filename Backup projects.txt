My current research focus on *control* and *autonomy*. In particular, I work on developing robust, adaptive and nonlinear control algorithms (with machine learning-enabled elements) to ensure safe and efficient operation of aerospace, robotic and autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. I am also interested in applying machine learning to optimize agricultural management for sustainable and resilient agriculture. Specific projects that I have been working on include
- Integrated planning and control for robotic and autonomous systems with nonlinear and uncertain dynamics
- Safe and robust learning-enabled control via active uncertainty compensation
- Adaptive control of aerospace systems under time-varying desired dynamics 
- Integrated adaptive control and reference governors for constrained control of uncertain systems
- Intelligent agricultural management with reinforcement learning
- Robust and gain-scheduled control with application to mechatronic systems


== Robust and optimal switching linear parameter-varying (LPV) control 
Real-world mechatronic, aerospace and robotic systems often have complex nonlinear and/or time-varying dynamics. Control design for such systems needs to consider these complex dynamics to ensure stability and performance. Linear parameter-varying (LPV) control provides a systematic and easy-to-implement way for gain-scheduled control of nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. 
To deal with large dynamics variation, switching LPV control has also been proposed for reducing the conservativeness of LPV control. In practice, the scheduling parameters (e.g., wind speed for a wind turbine system) are often measured with errors, and ignoring such errors in controller design could lead to degraded performance or even loss of stability. We proposed an approach to designing switching LPV controllers with stability and performance guarantees despite measurement errors in scheduling parameters. We also developed methods to optimally design a switching LPV controller’s switching surfaces for improved performance. These methods were applied to control an automotive engine and a floating wind turbine.

== Robust and gain-scheduled control of miniaturized optical image stabilizers (OISs)
In this project,  we developed robust and gain-scheduled controllers for miniaturized optical image stabilizers to deal with the inevitable product variations that induce dynamics change across different products. The controllers were experimentally validated on both large-scale and small-scale prototypes.
